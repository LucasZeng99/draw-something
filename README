CMPUT274 Fall Final Project

Project Name: Draw Something

Game Rules:
    this is a game that lets multiple players to guess the word that one of the players draws out.
    by compete who first gets the answer, the game ends with a winner or a tie.

    drawer:
        the drawer will be given a word and try to sketch it on the canvas,
            1. he/she can clear all lines and redraw.
            2. can draw until the time goes out and nobody has got the answer.
    
    guessers:
        all players who don't draw will be guessing the drawing's implication.
            1. they compete with each other to first get the answer(score)
            2. everyone gets a zero if nobody has got the answer.

Network and Wiring instructions:
    multiplayers:
        1. connect two/more laptops to a router, using ethernet cable.
        2. disconnect the laptops and the router from the Internet.(so that it uses LAN ip address.)
        if this is successfully setup, ping 192.168.0.xxx should have positive result. Now the game can start.

    On a single laptop:
        no specific network configuration needed, it's ok to use the public ip address of the machine.

Running Instructions:
    1. cd ./draw_something
    2. to run a server, do `python ./run_server.py`
            - number of players: a integer (> 1)
            - level: a integer (between 1 to 3 inclusive)
       to run a client(a pygame frontend), do `python ./run_client.py`
            - server's ip: the ip address shown by the server script above.
       there should be as many clients as players.
    3. starts drawing and try to guess the word!

    for testing on a single machine, a particular using case is:
        python ./run_server.py (input: 2 2)
            (copy the ip address shown)
            (open another 2 terminals)
        python ./run_client.py (on both) 
            (paste the ip address to each client)
